Bayesian short course
=======================

Welcome to a short course in Bayesian statistics.  This course is being taught in March 2014 at Station d'Ecologie Exp\ :math:`\textrm{\'{e}}`\ rimentale du CNRS :math:`\textrm{\`a}` `Moulis <http://www.ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr>`_.  The goal of the course is to use a :doc:`literate programming <LiterateProgramming>` style of analysis to carry out statistical tests commonly encountered in the biological sciences.  A major reason for using this style is that if you do it well once then you do not have to re-learn it again.  

All examples from this course can be reproduced easily.  Of course this course is also about Bayesian statistics and the scope is fairly limited, but focused on doing a few things well.  Interested participants will be pointed to resouces along the way to further their understanding of the different subjects.

What you will Need
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 1. :doc:`Latex` - a working version of :math:`\textrm{\LaTeX}` installed
 2. :doc:`R` - a current version of the statistical language R
 3. :doc:`Editor` - an editor that compiles :doc:`Sweave`

As an editor it will be easiest to use `RStudio <https://www.rstudio.com>`_.  However, :doc:`lpEdit` may be used for those looking to use languages other than R.  It is also possible for those who are inclined to avoid user interfaces entirely.  Something like `Emacs <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_ or another such editor could be used so that the examples are run from the command line.
