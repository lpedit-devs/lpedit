About LaTeX
===========

 is a typesetting language.  Reports, articles,
journal articles, dissertations, presentations and books are commonly
written in :math:`\textrm{\LaTeX}`.  As a scientist
:math:`\textrm{\LaTeX}` is the standard for carrying out research in a
reproducible way.  Word processors tend to use binary format, which
inhibit the use of technologies that help with :doc:`auditing
<AuditTrail>`.  Moreover, word processors have compatibility issues
between versions and between comparable programs.  Most, importantly,
:math:`\textrm{\LaTeX}` is freely available and produces high quality
attractive documents.

Installation
============

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    tutorials/LatexInstallWindows
    tutorials/LatexInstallOSX
    tutorials/LatexInstallLinux

Example Document
================
An example document written in :math:`\textrm{\LaTeX}`.

    .. code-block:: tex

        \documentclass[12pt]{article}
        \usepackage{amsmath} 
        \title{A sample document}
        \author{Author Name}
        \date{\today}

        \begin{document}
        \maketitle
  
        This is where the text goes.  Mathematical
        formulae, like $e=mc^{2}$ can easily be included.
  
        \end{document}

:math:`\textrm{\LaTeX}` documents need to be compiled into PDF, HTML,
Postscript or another format that the user specifies.  Editors (see
editor list below) can compile these documents at the click of a
button.  Otherwise, you can navigate to the folder where a file is
saved and use:

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        $ pdflatex name-of-latex-document.tex

To view the output of the above document as a PDF.
