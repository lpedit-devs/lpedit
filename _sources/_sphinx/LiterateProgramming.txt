Literate programming
====================

The idea of 'literate programming' was invented by `Donald Knuth
<http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth>`_.  The concept is quite
simple---the decriptions that accompany code should be informative and
progress from beginning to end with logical and clearly written text.
This is in contrast from the more conventional style of terse
commenting used in software development.  Another important part of
literate programming is that the code embedded within the text should
be easily run by the reader, which necessitates the use of working
examples.

Literate programming does not have to be restricted to developers.  A
driving force behind the creation of :doc:`lpEdit` was so that
researchers of many backgrounds could incorportate literate
programming into their scientific lives.
