Gibbs samplers
==============

What is a Gibbs sampler
-------------------------------

`Gibbs sampling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling>`_ is a `Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo>`_ for obtaining samples from a distribution.  

BUGS means Bayesian Inference Under Gibbs Sampling.

On windows
------------

You have the choice.  There are several Gibbs samplers that work well on windows.

   * `winBUGS <http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/contents.shtml>`_
   * `OpenBUGS <http://www.openbugs.info/w/FrontPage>`_
   * `JAGS <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net>`_

I am not actively tesing on window so here are a couple of websites that might help you get started with BUGS going on your machine.  It is apparently different if you have a 32 or 64 bit machine.  The second link has quite a lot of details on installation.  The examples in this website are tested using JAGS.

On GNU/Linux
--------------
  
   .. code-block:: bash

      ~$ sudo apt-get install jags


For non-debian based distros use the `sourceforge page <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net>`_ for more information.  For OSX users there are dmg installation images available.
