LaTeX Installation Windows
==========================

Basic installation
----------------------

On Windows in order to install LaTeX you will need the TeX
distribution which comes as a bundle called `MiKTeX
<http://miktex.org>`_.  Under the list of MiKTeX releases go to the
download link for the most recent version.  From that page download
the installer.  If you already have an older version uninstall any
previous versions before installing the newest.

After you have installed MiKTeX, it is helpful if you install a few
LaTeX packages.  From the start menu go to MikiTeX and use the
package interface to install the following packages:

  1. pgf
  2. ms
  3. xcolor
  4. beamer 
  5. natbib
  6. sweave
  7. facyvrb
  8. upquote
  9. mptopdf.

These are the most commonly used packages.
