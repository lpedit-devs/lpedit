Resources and Presentations
===========================

The goal of this project is to develop a set of free open source
resources to facilitate and promote adherence to the principles of
reproducible analysis and literate programming. The web portion of the
acts as a resource for training workshops that will teach and promote
adherence to reproducible and literate analysis.

In addition to this web-resource we have developed a tool called
:doc:`lpEdit`, which is a cross-platform editor that through the use
of templates reduces the burden of work as researchers perform the
task of :doc:`literate programming <LiterateProgramming>`.

The resources available here may be anything related to the integral
components of reproducible research: :doc:`data sharing
<DataSharing>`, establishing an :doc:`audit trail <AuditTrail>`, and
:doc:`documentation <Documentation>`.

Getting started:
________________ 

To get started with literate programming either via :doc:`lpEdit` or
using an :doc:`editor <Editor>` of your choice a version of
:doc:`Latex` must be installed on your system.  Once you have
installed your editor and your LaTeX distribution move on to the
:doc:`Tutorial` to start creating reproducible documents.
