lpEdit - towards reproducible research
=============================================

Reproducibility in research can be divided into experimental and analytic components. The aspects of data sharing, leaving an audit trail and documentation are essential to reproducible research, whether it is in the laboratory or on a computer. :doc:`lpEdit <lpEdit>` is a cross-platform application that enables a broad range of scientists to carry out the analytic component of their work in a reproducible manner---through the use of literate programming.

:doc:`lpEdit <lpEdit>` is a way to perform data analyses such that the code and prose are mixed to produce a final report that reads like an article or book. The extensive use of templates and documentation reduces the learning burden on researchers. In addition, an editor designed specifically for the task of literate programming minimizes the technical understanding necessary to incorporate aspects of good reproducible practices into daily research routines.

This project is community-based and to learn more visit the :doc:`Contributors` page.
