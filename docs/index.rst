lpEdit - A Resource on Reproducible Research
=============================================

Reproducibility in research can be divided into experimental and
analytic components. The aspects of data sharing, leaving an audit
trail and documentation are essential to reproducible research,
whether it is in the laboratory or on a computer. :doc:`lpEdit
<lpEdit>` is a cross-platform application that enables a broad range
of scientists to carry out the analytic component of their work in a
reproducible manner---through the use of literate programming.

:doc:`LiterateProgramming` is a way to perform data analyses such that the
code and prose are mixed to produce a final report that reads like an
article or book. The extensive use of templates and documentation
reduces the learning burden on researchers. In addition, an editor
designed specifically for the task of literate programming minimizes
the technical understanding necessary to incorporate aspects of good
reproducible practices into daily research routines.

This site also serves as documentation for the literate programming
editor :doc:`lpEdit <lpEdit>` as well as a general resource for
reproducible research. This project is community-based and to learn
more visit the :doc:`Contributors` page.
